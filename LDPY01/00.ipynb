    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, robust, high level programming language. It is very easy to pick up even if you are completely new to programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python, similar to other languages like matlab or R, is interpreted hence runs slowly compared to C++, Fortran or Java. However writing programs in Python is very quick. Python has a very large collection of libraries for everything from scientific computing to web services. It caters for object oriented and functional programming with module system that allows large and complex applications to be developed in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course uses jupyter notebooks which mix Python code with documentation. The Python notebooks can be run on a webserver or stand-alone on a computer.\n"

However the recommended way to install python under Microsoft Windows or Linux is to use the Anaconda distribution available at [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Make sure to get the latest Python version (currently 3.6) rather than the soon to be deprecated Python 2.7 (to be retired in less than 2 years from now).\n",
